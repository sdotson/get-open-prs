When calling effects to fetch data in parallel, you may not want one failure to cause the other effects to be cancelled.\r\n\r\nI was not sure what the desired response object should look like, so I left it simple and am open to changing it if there is something that would be better or more useful. While this is similar to [promise settling](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/reflect.html), using the [PromiseInspection](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/promiseinspection.html) interface didn't seem appropriate.\r\n\r\nIf you agree this is a useful effect combinator, I will write the docs for it. I didn't want to spend that time until this proposal was accepted and the response object format was agreed upon.\r\n\r\nBTW - This is a great library, thank you for all your hard work!\r\n\r\ncc - @spaintrain",
